## Fonts
We are using 3 fonts in the project:
- SFUIDisplay: main font that is used for AppBar title
- SFUIText
- SFProText

All fonts must be located under /fonts directory and described in `pubspec.yaml`.
Basic information about fonts on Flutter developer site can be found [here].(https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/design/fonts)
